## Projects

### Current – Performant Video Player
**Repo:** [performantvideo](https://github.com/jordypg/performantvideo)

Faster scrubbing controls when viewing videos.

- frame.io and other web video players struggle with buffering when playing forwards at high speeds or backwards. Building a method for better performance.
- Encoding a reversed version of the video with a circular buffer of rendered frames for instant backward navigation without re-decoding
- Mipmap-style pre-computed versions of the video at faster playback rates for lag-free display

### 2025 – Orbit Pipeline
**Repo:** [orbit](https://github.com/jordypg/orbit)

A pipeline execution framework built for a monolith infrastructure.

- **[Demo video](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/7q3d2a5381qbfy85rihrw/Pipeline_Demo.mov?rlkey=v56imgexpmxtyu1fvjcgndiiv&st=0zg2e4nf&dl=0)** showing it off!
- Operates in your TypeScript backend, using type-safe handlers instead of YAML configs. A library to import rather than a platform to deploy.
- Built-in and configurable behavior for automatic retry logic, state persistence, crash recovery, background workers, and real-time performance monitoring
- CLI functionality
- Web dashboard interface for monitoring and management
