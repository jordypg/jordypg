I like ML and databases, and I'd like to learn more about containerization.

I would like to one day build a great system for the training of top-tier models, or to architect a massive company-saving database refactoring.

More work that's not visible here:

2024 - recent database work for Amherst depts/labs is in private repos for security purposes, but I wrote about them in my LinkedIn projects. Apologies for the inconvienience.

2023 - My math major

2022 - LLM lay summary of scientific papers: [PEGembed](https://huggingface.co/jordypg/PEGembed)

2021 - Worked at now-defunct RPA startup Mesmer, which leveraged computer vision models for automated app testing. I made an AWS pipeline for handling training and model data during the fine-tuning of these models. I also trained models myself using xgboost, and modularized and refactored various code.

2020 - Collaborated with Prof. Lee Spector and fellow researchers in autoconstructive evolution and genetic programming projects. This was centered around the family of genetic programming languages Push; in hopes of understanding AI black-box behavior, I made a visualizer in Clojure to visually present the execution of these models.
