Projects:

2025 – Collaborative Canvas Planner. Repo: [CanvasPlanner](https://github.com/jordypg/canvasplanner)

2024 – Amherst Database Infra (in private repos for security purposes). I wrote about them in my LinkedIn [projects](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordan-perry-greene-873870279/details/projects/)!
- Religion Library DB, Lycium DB, Hollaway Classics Library DB, Binary Worlds Lab Website
- Currently in production on Amherst servers
- Developed full-stack, and built REST APIs (TypeScript, React, Next.js, Node.js, Flask, PostgreSQL)
- Designed scalable, reliable database architecture handling concurrent access and complex query workloads
- Working with department members for requirements gathering and analysis

2023 - Completed my math major! Focus on Galois and Group Theory.

2022 - LLM lay summary of scientific papers: [PEGembed](https://huggingface.co/jordypg/PEGembed). For the grad course Advanced NLP w/Prof. Mohit Iyyer, developed over 4 months with the help of Zhiheng Wang, Jiarui Liu, and Ahmed Jaafar.
- Researched and developed fine-tuned generative AI model
- Adapted [Seungwon Kim's method (2020)](https://aclanthology.org/2020.sdp-1.38/) of extractive summary, followed by abstractive summary
- Extractive summary using cosine similarity to extract top N sentences
- Pre-trained PEGASUS model, fine-tuned on the eLife dataset
- Met baseline models on metrics BERTScore and METEOR, while outperforming all baselines  on ROUGE-2 (33%), ROUGE-L (35%), and Human Lay Readability (21%)

2022 - Denoising Images with Anisotropic Total Variation. Repo: [Anisotropic-Total-Variation](https://github.com/jordypg/Anisotropic-Total-Variation)

2021 - AI Engineering Internship at the Intel-funded RPA startup Mesmer, which leveraged computer vision models for automated app testing.
- Creating AWS pipelines for handling training and model data during the fine-tuning of these models.
- Building monitoring and error recovery for pipeline robusstness
- Training models using XGBoost
- Modularizing and refactoring various code.

2020 - Genetic programming research in a team led by Prof. Lee Spector. This was centered around the family of genetic programming languages Push; in hopes of understanding AI black-box behavior, I made a visualizer in Clojure to visually present the execution of these models.



In summary –
GitHub readme updated with sentences for:
- Canvas Planner (+ video)
- Pipeline Orchestrator (+ video)
- Video Player

I like ML, fullstack development, and databases.


2025 – Managing data collection and reporting for service organizations @Trestle
