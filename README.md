I like ML and databases, and I'd like to learn more about containerization.

I would like to one day build a great system for the training of top-tier models, or to architect a company-saving database refactoring.

More work that's not visible here:

2025 â€“ Managing data collection and reporting for service organizations @Trestle

2024 - recent database work for Amherst depts/labs is in private repos for security purposes. I wrote about them in my LinkedIn [projects](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordan-perry-greene-873870279/details/projects/)!

2023 - My math major

2022 - LLM lay summary of scientific papers: [PEGembed](https://huggingface.co/jordypg/PEGembed)

2021 - Worked at now-defunct RPA startup Mesmer, which leveraged computer vision models for automated app testing. I made an AWS pipeline for handling training and model data during the fine-tuning of these models. I also trained models myself using xgboost, and modularized and refactored various code.

2020 - Genetic programming research in a team led by Prof. Lee Spector. This was centered around the family of genetic programming languages Push; in hopes of understanding AI black-box behavior, I made a visualizer in Clojure to visually present the execution of these models.
